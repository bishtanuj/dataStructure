# _Stack_

_Let's dive into the world of **stacks**, a fundamental data structure. Imaginge a stack of plates - you add plates on top, and when you need to remove one, you take it from top. That's essence of a stack!_

### What is a Stack?
- A **stack** is a **linear data strucutre** that follows the **Last - In - First - Out (LIFO)** principle.
- Think of it as a stack of plates: the last plate added is the first one to be removed.
- The only element you can remove from a stack is the one at the **top**.

### Basic Operations of a Stack:
1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **IsFull**: Chaecks if the stack is full (in case of fixed - size arrays).

### Applications of Stacks:
- **Recursion**: Stacks can play a crucial role in recursive function calls.
- **Expression Evaluation and Parsing**: Stacks help evaluate expressions (like infix to postfix conversion).
- **Depth - First Search (DFS)**: Used in graph traversal algorithms.
- **Undo/Redo Operations**: Think of undoing actions in software applications.
- **Browser History**: Stacks can track your browsing history.

### Implementation of Stacks:
- You can implement a stack using various data structures:
    - **Arrays**: Fixed - size arrays work well stacks.
    - **Linked Lists**: Dynamic implementation with no fixed size.
    - **Other Languages**: Stacks are available in C++, Java, Python, and more.
 
Remember, stacks are like those neatly piled plates - orderly and efficient! :smile:
