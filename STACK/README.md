# _Stack_

_Let's dive into the world of **stacks**, a fundamental data structure. Imaginge a stack of plates - you add plates on top, and when you need to remove one, you take it from top. That's essence of a stack!_

### What is a Stack?
- A **stack** is a **linear data strucutre** that follows the **Last - In - First - Out (LIFO)** principle.
- Think of it as a stack of plates: the last plate added is the first one to be removed.
- The only element you can remove from a stack is the one at the **top**.
