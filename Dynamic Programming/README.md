# _Dynamic Programming_

_**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a powerful technique used in mathematics and computer science to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. By solving such subproblems just once and storing the results, DP avoids redundant computations, leading to efficient solutions for a wide range of problems._
