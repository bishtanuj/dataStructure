# _Dynamic Programming_

_**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a powerful technique used in mathematics and computer science to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. By solving such subproblems just once and storing the results, DP avoids redundant computations, leading to efficient solutions for a wide range of problems._

Here are some key aspects of dynamic programming:
1. **Identifying Subproblems**:
    - DP starts by dividing the main problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
    - These subproblems are often related to each other, and solving them contibutes to solving the overall problem.
2. **Storing Solutions**:
    - As we solve each subproblem, we store the solution in a table or an array.
    - This storage allows us to avoid recalculating the same subproblem in the future.
3. **Building Up Solutions**:
    - We use the stored solutions to construct the solution to the main problem.
    - By combining the results of subproblems, we arrive at the final answer.
4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:
