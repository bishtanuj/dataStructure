# Algorithm
> ***It is a finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code. It can be represented as an
informal description by flowchart or pseudocode.***

## Characteristics of Algorithm
**_Unambiguous:_** All the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple. <br>
**_Input:_** An algorithm should have some input value. <br>
**_Output:_** An algoritm should be capable of giving output at the end. <br>
**_Finiteness:_** An algorithm should have finite number of steps such that it gets terminate after a finite time. <br>
**_Effectiveness:_** An algoithm should be effective as each step of algorithm affects the whole process. <br>
**_Feasibility:_** An algorithm shoud be feasible with the available resources. <br>
**_Language Independent:_** An algorithm should be independent of programming language as it is capable of solving problem. <br>

## Advantages of Algorithm
**_Easy Communication_:** The algorithm is written in human language (e.g. English), hence, becomes easy to understand it as a solution of particular problem. <br>
**_Easy Debugging:_** A well designed algorithm facilitates easy debugging to detect the logical errors that occurred inside the program. <br>
**_Easy and Efficient Coding:_** An algorithm is nothing but a blueprint of a program that helps develop a program. <br>
**_Independent of Programming Language:_** Since an algorithm is language independent, therefore can be programmed in any high level language. <br>

## Disadvantages of Algorithm
* Developing algorithms for complex problems would be time-consuming and difficult to understand.
* It is a challenging task to understand complex logic through algorithms.

## Need of Algorithm
1. To understand the basic idea of problem and find a right approach to solve it.
2. To improve the efficiency of existing techniques.
3. To understand the flow of the problem.
4. It is the best method of description without describing the implementation detail.
5. The Algorithm gives a clear description of requirements and goal of the problem to the designer.
6. It can be used to analyze the space and time complexity of the problems concerning inputs without implementing and running, that reduces the cost of design.
