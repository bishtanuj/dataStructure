# Algorithm
> ***It is a finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code. It can be represented as an
informal description by flowchart or pseudocode.***

## Characteristics of Algorithm
**_Unambiguous_** <br>
All the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple. <br>
**_Input_** <br>
An algorithm should have some input value. <br>
**_Output_** <br>
An algoritm should be capable of giving output at the end. <br>
**_Finiteness_** <br>
An algorithm should have finite number of steps such that it gets terminate after a finite time. <br>
**_Effectiveness_** <br>
An algoithm should be effective as each step of algorithm affects the whole process. <br>
**_Feasibility_** <br>
An algorithm shoud be feasible with the available resources. <br>
**_Language Independent_** <br>
An algorithm should be independent of programming language as it is capable of solving problem. <br>

## Advantages of Algorithm
**_Easy Communication_** <br>
The algorithm is written in human language (e.g. English), hence, becomes easy to understand it as a solution of particular problem. <br>
**_Easy Debugging_** <br>
A well designed algorithm facilitates easy debugging to detect the logical errors that occurred inside the program. <br>
**_Easy and Efficient Coding_** <br>
An algorithm is nothing but a blueprint of a program that helps develop a program. <br>
**_Independent of Programming Language_** <br>
Since an algorithm is language independent, therefore can be programmed in any high level language. <br>
