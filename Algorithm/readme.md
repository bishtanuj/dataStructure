# Algorithm
> ***It is a finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code. It can be represented as an
informal description by flowchart or pseudocode.***

## Characteristics of Algorithm
### _Unambiguous_
All the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple.
### _Input_
An algorithm should have some input value.
### _Output_
An algoritm should be capable of giving output at the end.
### _Finiteness_
An algorithm should have finite number of steps such that it gets terminate after a finite time.
### _Effectiveness_
An algoithm should be effective as each step of algorithm affects the whole process.
### _Feasibility_
An algorithm shoud be feasible with the available resources.
### _Language Independent_
An algorithm should be independent of programming language as it is capable of solving problem.
