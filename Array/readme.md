# Array
> ***The simplest form of array is "One Dimensional Array".***

<br><br>
***Array is a finite ordered set of homogeneous elements.***
* ***"Finite"*** means that there is a specific number of elements in the array. This number may be large or small, but it must exist.
* ***"Ordered"*** means that the elements of the array are arranged so that there is a zeroth, first, second, and so forth elements.
* ***"Homogeneous"*** means that all the elements in the array must be of the same type.

The two basic operations that access an array are **extraction** and **storing.** <br>
The smallest element of an array's index is called its **lower bound** and the highest element is called its **upper bound.** <br>
If lower is the lower bound of an array and upper is the upper bound, the number of elements in the array is called the **range.** <br>
**`range = upper - lower + 1`**
