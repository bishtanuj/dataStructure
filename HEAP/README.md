# Heap Data Structure
Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property such that:
* Every node is always greater than its child node(s) and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called **max heap property**.
* Every node is always smaller than its child node(s) and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called **min heap property**.
