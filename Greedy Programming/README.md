# _Greedy Programming_

_A **greedy algorithm** is a type of optimization algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the goal of finding a **globally optimal solution**. It operates  on the principle of "taking the best option now" without considering the long-term consequences._

Here are the key points about the greedy algorithms:
1. **Definition**: A greedy algorithm follows the problem - solving heuristic of making the **locally optimal choice** at each stage. It aims to find a solution in the **shortest time possible** by selecting the best option available at the current moment, without regard for the overall optimization of the final solution.
