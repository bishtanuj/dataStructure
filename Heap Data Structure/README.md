# _Heap Data Structure_

_A **heap** is a specialized tree - based data strucutre that plays a crucial role in various algorithms and applications._

Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property such that:
* Every node is always greater than its child node(s) and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called **max heap property**.
* Every node is always smaller than its child node(s) and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called **min heap property**.

## Heap Operations
Some of the operations on heap are described below:

### Heapify
Heapify is the process of creating a heap data structure from a binary tree. It is used to create a min-heap or a max-heap.
