# _QUEUE_

_A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** order. In other words, the element inserted first will be the first to be removed._

Here are some key points about queues:
1. **Order**: Elements are processed in the order they arrive.
2. **Operations**:
    - **Enqueue**: Insert an element at the rear end.
    - **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front end.
