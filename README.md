# Data Structure

<p><strong>As name suggests, it is a way of organizing and storing data in memory in such manner that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.</strong></p>

<p>To structure the data many algorithms were proposed, which are known as <strong>abstract data type</strong></p>

## There are two types of data structures:
<ul>
  <li>Primitive Data Structure</li>
  <li>Non-Primitive Data Structure</li>
</ul>

### Primitive Data Structure:
<p>These are the primitive data types which can hold the single value. For example int, char, float, double, pointer.</p>

### Non - Primitive Data Structure:
<p>These are further divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linear Data Structure</li>
    <li>Non - Linear Data Structure</li>
</ul>

#### Linear Data Structure
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      It is a type of data structure where the arrangement of data is such that the each element is directly connected to its previous and next elements.
      <br>
      For example: Array, Linked List, Queue, Stack.
    </li>
    <li>
      All the elements in linear data structure can be traversed in single run.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

#### Non - Linear Data Structure
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is a type of data structure where the arrangement of data is such that the each element is directly connected with more than one element.
      <br>
      For example: Trees, Graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      All the elements in non - linear data structure can not be tranversed in a single run.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1><strong>Data Structures can also be classified as:</strong></h1>
<ol>
  <li>Static Data Structure</li>
  <li>Dynamic Data Structure</li>
</ol>
