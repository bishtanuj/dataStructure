# Data Structure

<p><strong>As name suggests, it is a way of organizing and storing data in memory in such manner that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.</strong></p>

<p>To structure the data many algorithms were proposed, which are known as <strong>abstract data type</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of data structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Primitive Data Structure</li>
  <li>Non-Primitive Data Structure</li>
</ul>
