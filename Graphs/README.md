# _Graphs_

_A **graph** is a non- linear data structure that consists of vertices (also known as nodes) connected by **edges**. These edges represent relationship between different entities. Graphs are used to model various real - world scenarios and can be analyzed using graph algorithms._

Here are some key points about graphs:
1. **Components of a Graph**:
    - **Vertices**: These are the fundamental units of the graph. Each vertex represents an entity or a point in the graph.
    - **Edges**: Edges connect two vertices and represent the relationships between them. Edges can be directed (with the specific direction) or unidirected (bidirectional).
    - A graph is formally denoted as **G(V, E)**, where **V** is the set of vertices and **E** is the set of edges.
2. **Basic Operations on Graphs**:
    - **Insertion**: Adding vertices or edges to the graph.
    - **Deletion**: Removing vertices or edges from the graph.
    - **Searching**: Finding a specific entity (vertex) in the graph.
    - **Traversal**: Visiting all nodes in the graph.
